# Greenhouse Gas Emission Regression Project
# Introduction
In today's world, understanding and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is crucial in combating climate change. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting GHG emission data using machine learning regression models. We will walk through the steps of data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data, which contains information on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of various GHGs such as:

- Carbon dioxide (CO2)
- Methane (CH4)
- Nitrous oxide (N2O)
- Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
- Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
- Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)
- Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)


The data spans from 1990 to the latest available year and includes the following columns:


- country_or_area: The country or area where the data was collected.
- year: The year of the data.
- value: The amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
- category: The type of greenhouse gas.


# Results
## Linear Regression:
- Mean Squared Error: [Insert MSE value]
- R-squared: [Insert R-squared value]
## XGBoost Regression:
- Mean Squared Error: [Insert MSE value]
- R-squared: [Insert R-squared value]
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building regression models to analyze and predict greenhouse gas emissions. By following the steps outlined above, you can replicate this analysis and adapt it to other datasets and models. Understanding GHG emissions is a crucial step toward creating effective policies and measures to combat climate change.

# Next Steps
- Model Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Feature Engineering: Include additional features such as economic indicators or population data to enhance the model.
- Comparative Analysis: Compare the regression models with other regression techniques to find the best-performing model.
